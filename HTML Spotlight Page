      <p class="rm1Text">In 2012 a gunman boarded Malala's school bus and shot her on the left side of her head. This simple act brought awareness to the gender inequality in the education sector of Pakistan. Waking up 10 days later in Birmingham UK, Malala decided that she would use her voice to advocate for young girls everywhere. With that, she established the Malala Fund. Now, every year on the 12th of July we celebrate Malala Day to remember all the challenges and sacrifices Malala and her family endured in order to ensure that every girl had the opportunity to go to school.</p>

       <h3 class="rt">Emma Watson</h3>
      <p class="rm2Text">On September 20, 2014, Emma Watson (British actor and Goodwill Ambassador for U.N. Women) delivered a speech on gender inequality and the steps to fight it. Alongside it, she launched the HeForShe intiative, which targets men and boys to join the feminist fight for gender equality. In her speech, she addressed an important factor in achieving gender equality: getting rid of harmful and destructive stereotypes of masculinity and behavioral expectations for men and boys (source: Nicki Lisa Cole, Ph.D. for ThoughtCo).<br>
      <!--In her speech she states, "Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong… It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum not as two opposing sets of ideals."--></p>

        Karlie Kloss is an American fashion model and computer programmer. She launched the 2-week programming camp "Kode with Klossy" for girls 13-18 years of age to create a safe environment where girls can explore and step into the world of computer science. As of 2018, the camp has expanded to include 50 coding camps in 25 US cities, teaching over 1000 girls to code (CNET). 
By the end of the program, those partaking in the camp build their own fully functional mobile apps or websites.</p>

      <h3 class = "lt">Rain Dove Dubilewski </h3>
      <p class="rm1Text"> Rain Dove Dubilewski is an American model, actor, and activist, best known for their work in subversive fashion, as a gender-nonconforming model, posing alternately as male and female in photoshoots, productions, and runway shows. Dove was named one of Elle Magazine's 12 Women Who Are Redefining Beauty in 2015. A self-described "gender capitalist," Dove stated, "I've never really cared about pronouns for my own descriptors", and that they disavow personal pronouns and ask people to choose whichever they feel apply: "Use she, he, it, one, they ... I honestly don't care ... All I'm listening for in that sound is positivity.</p>

      <p class="rm2Text"> 
        In 2019, Martin starred in the comedy film Little, which she also produced, becoming the youngest person ever to produce a studio film. The same year, Time magazine named her on its "Time 100 Next." Now, Martin heads her own production company, Genius Productions. Her aim is to tell more stories, with diverse casts, that people her age can relate to—in other words, she’s shaping the culture, a far cry from just selling it to an audience (Stephanie Zacharek).</p>
